sphere_walk.py simulates a random walk with n=20 steps on the sphere, and then plots the result and saves to a file.

sphereMSD.py simulates an ensemble of m=15,000 random walks for n=0 steps up to n=20 steps, measures the displacement, and averages over all walks with the same number of steps, which is then plotted together with an exponential of best fit.
